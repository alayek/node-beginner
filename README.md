# node-beginner
Node JS App, based on the awesome tutorial in "Node Beginner".

Better run on Linux or Mac.

Before running, make sure you have `formidable` installed.
If not, run `$npm i formidable` to install the same.

To run, execute `$node index` and browse to `localhost:<port` 
where `<port>` is the port which gets printed at console when you run `index.js`
